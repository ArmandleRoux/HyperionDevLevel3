Update anomaly:
  An update anomaly can occur whith the prod_num and prod_label. Everywhere the prod_num is the same
  the prod_label will be the same. This can create an inconsistency in the data of all rows are not
  successfully updated in every time. 

  To prevent this from happening the prod_num and prod_label will have its own table that is linked to
  the main table through the prod_num column thus preventing updates of multiple columns in a row.


Insertion anomaly:
  To add a new product you have to create an new invoice first and this requires data you do not have
  so some columns may be left empty which may cause an error as we need an invoice number because it
  is a primary key.

  To prevent this the products will have their own table to add in new products as you wish and can be 
  accessed by the main table through a foreign key.

Deletion anomaly:
  If you delete an invoice you risk the chance of deleting information of the row such as the vend_name
  and vend_code.

  To prevent this your vendors will have their own table with their information stored that can be accessed
  by the main table through a foreign key thus ppreventing any valuble information from being deleted.
