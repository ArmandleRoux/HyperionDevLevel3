1.
 - How well it cleans.
   Its Hardiness.
   The smell.

 - How reliable is the plane.
   How far can it travel.
   How fast can it travel.

 - How does it taste.
   How does it smell.
   How healthy is it.

2. A high quality software process ensures proper software documentation and is built to 
   create a product of greater quality with the development team having standards to meet
   with the systems they build by working through different phases such as design, development
   and validation processing.

   If it is not possible for system to meet the standard you might waste a lot
   of time reworking the system to meet the standard set for the process. Agile
   development will also not always work very well with a high quality software
   process as the process ensures for proper software documentation where as Agile 
   development does not have such formal software documentation.

3. Program inspection can effectively discover errors due to the code being compared line by
   line to a checklist of errors or common problems that may be found. This is effective because
   you are looking for specific problem in the code.

   Logical error will be difficult to detect with this method as logical error as better detected 
   by testing the software rather than reading through the code.

4. Each product has different requirments and specifications thus the relationships between internal
   and external attributes differs for each product making it difficult to have a standard for validation.
