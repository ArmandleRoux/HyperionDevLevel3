From what i observed I can see that the fewer births per 1000 people there are in a country the
higher the life expectancy of that country will be. From 1953 to 2008 it seems that most countries
tried to lower their birthrates which raised their life expectancy. The rate at which the life expectancy
increases compared to the lowering of birth rate is not constant across all countries which indicates
another factor that is involved with life expectancy.

It seems that the 2008 countries that are in the group with majority 1953 coutries are poorer than the
other countries. Although these countries have lowered their birth rate their life expectancy is still
very low. There is a cluster of countries that have quite a high life expectancy to birth rate ration
with olny a single 1953 country Iceland. Wealthy countries can give their people better health care
which can also lead to highger life expectancy.

The second largest cluster consist of mostly well off countries that have a low birth rate and a
high life expectancy. This cluster contains a few countries from 1953 that have historically been
pretty whealthy countries. Most of those countries are still in the cluster in 2008 and are joined
by other nations that had good economical growth from 1953 to 2008.
