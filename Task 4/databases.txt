1. Data is unstructured and difficult to read and consist of raw facts.
   Information is data that has been restructured to make it easier to read and understand \
   and can be used for finding behavioural paterns.

2. Sparse data is where the data collected has readings with no information.
   The alternative is missing data where the data collected has readings with
   missing information rather than no information. With missing data you will
   either have to manually enter the information of the missing data with it 
   having an effect on the end result or try the experiment again.
