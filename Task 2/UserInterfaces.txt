1. Bad UI
   The home interface is very cluttered and busy. It could be made more simple.
   Although colours, textures and typography is used it is not used 
   purposefully. The colours that are use blend with each other and make 
   it dificult to see what is going on. Some of the text is very small 
   and uses a difficult to read font.
   The layout of the website is very unstructured there is large gaps between 
   images, paragraphs are devided by images and is difficult to read and none
   of the images have discriptions which makes it difficult to know what you
   are lookig at.

2. Good UI
   The layout is very clean and simple. The elements of the webpage are where
   you would expect them to be such as the cart and login buttons in the top 
   right corner. The colours used work with the theme of the website. The 
   typography is used with purpose and you can clearly distinguish the headings
   from each other. The font is easy to read and a good size. The website 
   communicates with you and you can see what is going on eg. There is a loading 
   icon when you click on a link to show the user the page is loading.
